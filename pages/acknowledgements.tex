First of all I want to thank my advisor Martin Kleehaus for putting a lot of time and effort supporting me during the last months. His constructive feedback was of enormous value for the fulfillment of this thesis.

Furthermore, I want to thank Dr. Matheus Hauder and Martin Leichter for advising me on the industrial part of this work. Your support and feedback were also of immense value. 


I would like to thank Prof. Dr. Florian Matthes for giving me the opportunity to write my research topic at his chair and for his feedback.

In addition, I want to thank my team at the industry partner for making a collaboration possible, for participating in interviews and for the help during the last months.

Last but not least I would like to thank my family and friends for supporting me during the time of this work.
