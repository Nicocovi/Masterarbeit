abstract = {Current approaches for enterprise architecture lack analytical instruments for cyclic evaluations of business and system architectures in real business enterprise system environments. This impedes the broad use of enterprise architecture methodologies. Furthermore, the permanent evolution of systems desynchronizes quickly model representation and reality. Therefore we are introducing an approach for complementing the existing top-down approach for the creation of enterprise architecture with a bottom approach. Enterprise Architecture Analytics uses the architectural information contained in many infrastructures to provide architectural information. By applying Big Data technologies it is possible to exploit this information and to create architectural information. That means, Enterprise Architectures may be discovered, analyzed and optimized using analytics. The increased availability of architectural data also improves the possibilities to verify the compliance of Enterprise Architectures. Architectural decisions are linked to clustered architecture artifacts and categories according to a holistic EAM Reference Architecture with specific architecture metamodels. A special suited EAM Maturity Framework provides the base for systematic and analytics supported assessments of architecture capabilities.},

abstract = {IT environments that consist of a very large number of rather small structures like microservices, Internet of Things (IoT) components, or mobility systems are emerging to support flexible and agile products and services in the age of digital transformation. Biological metaphors of living and adaptable ecosystems with service-oriented enterprise architectures provide the foundation for self-optimizing, resilient run- time environments and distributed information systems. We are extending Enterprise Architecture (EA) methodologies and models that cover a high degree of heterogeneity and distribution to support the digital transformation and related information systems with micro-granular architectures. Our aim is to support flexibility and agile transformation for both IT and business capabilities within adaptable digital enterprise architectures. The present research paper investigates mechanisms for integrating Microservice Architectures (MSA) by extending original enterprise architecture reference models with elements for more flexible architectural metamodels and EA-mini-descriptions.},

abstract = {—Enterprise architecture modeling and model main-tenance are time-consuming and error-prone activities that are typically performed manually. This position paper presents new and innovative ideas on how to automate the modeling of enterprise architectures. We propose to view the problem of modeling as a probabilistic state estimation problem, which is addressed using Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBN). The proposed approach is described using a motivating example. Sources of machine-readable data about Enterprise Architecture entities are reviewed. Keywords—Enterprise Architecture, Automatic Modeling, Dy-namic Bayesian Networks.},

abstract = {During the last years, many companies established fast IT or digital IT units dedicated to build and operate digital customer-facing services. These units adopted agile methods, new tool chains as well as new organizational settings like BizDevOps teams. BizDevOps teams are responsible for continuously (re-)defining business functionality of certain (micro-)services, (re-)developing and running them. In these new fast IT environments, the role of enterprise architecture management changes dramatically. BizDevOps teams have a high degree of autonomy in designing both, the functionality and the architecture of their (micro-)services and thus contribute to business-IT-alignment in a new way. Nevertheless, a central enterprise architecture management (EAM) function is still required for supporting the teams regarding cross-team and cross-service issues. Furthermore, as many companies still run the traditional IT function side-by-side with the new IT function, the EAM functions of both parts have to cooperate. Based on a single case study, we discuss the emergence of a new EAM function ("fast IT EAM"), changing tasks and processes, implications for EA models and challenges for the integration of the traditional EAM and the fast IT EAM functions.},

@article{Manteuffel2014,
abstract = {Architecture decisions are often not explicitly documented in practice but reside in the architect's mind as tacit knowledge, even though explicit capturing and documentation of architecture decisions has been associated with a multitude of benefits. As part of a research collaboration with ABB, we developed a tool to document architecture decisions. This tool is an add-in for Enterprise Architect and is an implementation of a viewpoint-based decision documentation framework. To validate the add-in, we conducted an exploratory case study with ABB architects. In the study, we assessed the status quo of architecture decision documentation, identified architects' expectations of the ideal decision documentation tool, and evaluated the new add-in. We found that although awareness of decision documentation is increasing at ABB, several barriers exist that limit the use of decisions in practice. Regarding their ideal tool, architects want a descriptive and efficient approach. Supplemental features like reporting or decision sharing are requested. The new add-in, was well-perceived by the architects. As a result of the study, we propose a clearer separation of problem, outcomes, and alternatives for the decision documentation framework.
